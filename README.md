Several friends and I decided to enter the August 2014 Ludum Dare. The chosen theme was Connected Worlds. We decided to make a game where the population of an alien race was divided in two distant worlds, and the only way they can met is through an unstable rift in space.
The player must control both aliens at the same time and navigate both aliens to the end at the same time. As you move around, each tile you step on starts to crumble, and disintegrates after a few seconds. All levels are randomly generated. Each new level is harder then the one before, with false paths and gaps that you have to jump over.

All animations are created as sprites with each individual frame drawn separately. We used unityâ€™s animation engine to create player walking, jumping, and falling animations.

# Technical Architecture
The game consists of several Scenes in Unity. Most are small simple schenes dedicated to displaying the title screen, story slides, victory, and game over screens. The Main scene uses a level generator to get a generated layout of the current level. The level dificulty is determined by the level number. Each time the player gets to the end we increment the level and reload the main scene. We keep track of the current level using the PlayerPrefs API. The api is usually used to store player preferences between game sessions.
